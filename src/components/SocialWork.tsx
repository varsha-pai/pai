                Beyond technology and art, I'm deeply committed to using my skills for social impact. I believe that education and access to resources can transform lives, and I actively volunteer my time to initiatives that promote these values.

                My journey in social work began when I realized how many bright, curious minds lack access to quality education and technological tools. This realization inspired me to start teaching in local government schools, where I could share my knowledge and passion for STEM subjects.

                What started as occasional volunteering has evolved into a sustained commitment to community development. Through teaching, workshops, and creative programs, I aim to bridge educational gaps and create opportunities for children from underserved communities.

After weeks of patient guidance, she created her first digital artwork â€“ a colorful landscape that represented her home village. The pride in her eyes when she saw her creation on screen is a moment I'll never forget. It reminded me why I do this work: to witness the spark that ignites when someone realizes what they're capable of achieving."
